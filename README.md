# Forma Arm
Welcome to the official repository for **Forma Robotics' open-source robotic arm**.  
This project aims to make robotics accessible to anyone — builders, researchers, students, and hobbyists.  
Everything here is **modular, open-source, and designed for real-world deployment**.

## Overview
Forma’s robotic arm is built around:
- **Modular hardware** — interchangeable joints and planetary gearboxes
- **Affordable manufacturing** — designed for easy fabrication using 3D printing
- **RaaS (Robotics-as-a-Service) ready** — intended for deployment to the Forma decentralized network

## CAD
The following CAD components are currently available in this repo:
- ✅ Base link (mounting structure for the first joint)
- ✅ Link1 (first arm segment connected to the base + lid)
- ✅ Servo module components
